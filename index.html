      <h2>Development Postmortem</h2>
  
      <h3>‚úÖ What Went Well</h3>
      <p>One of the major improvements in Iteration 2 was task delegation. Each team member was assigned a single feature at the beginning, which resulted in more organized work and a balanced distribution of responsibilities. Additionally, features like the recipe detail view, filtering system, cooking instructions, and explore page were implemented effectively and integrated without major conflicts.</p>
      <p>We also started applying design patterns like Singleton, Factory Method, Adapter, and Observer in key parts of our application. These decisions helped simplify our architecture and improve maintainability.</p>
  
      <h3>‚ö†Ô∏è What Went Wrong</h3>
      <p>Despite recognizing the need for more consistent meetings in our Iteration 1 retrospective, we failed to significantly improve this area in Iteration 2. Communication delays persisted, with questions often going unanswered for long periods. Scheduling regular team check-ins is something we need to prioritize going forward.</p>
      <p>We also encountered technical debt due to rushed development ‚Äî for example, improper placement of code in the main method in `CookingInstructionActivity`, and a misused static inner class in `RecipeAdapter`. These issues were identified and refactored post-implementation.</p>
  
      <h3>üîÑ What We‚Äôd Do Differently</h3>
      <p>If we had the chance to restart, we would enforce a stricter communication schedule, start using a shared task board earlier (such as GitHub issues with milestones), and plan time for code review to avoid technical debt buildup.</p>
  
      <h3>üí° Lessons Learned</h3>
      <p>We learned the importance of readable, maintainable code ‚Äî several of us created utility methods and helper classes to improve clarity and reusability. Agile practices such as branching by feature, retrospectives, and user stories helped us stay focused even when things got busy.</p>
  
      <h3>üìä Quantitative Insights</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Project included over <strong>20 Java classes</strong>, with a strong focus on presentation and service layers.</li>
        <li>Average time per feature: <strong>1‚Äì2 weeks</strong>, depending on complexity.</li>
        <li>Design patterns used: <strong>Singleton, Factory, Adapter, Observer, Facade</strong>.</li>
        <li>Most time-consuming feature: <strong>CookingInstructionActivity</strong> (involved timer logic, notes, and UI coordination).</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h3>üõ†Ô∏è Iteration 2 Retrospective Follow-up</h3>
      <p>We aimed to improve our meeting frequency, but this unfortunately saw little progress. On the other hand, we succeeded in balancing workload better by assigning individual features. Communication still needs further improvement, especially with timely responses and availability.</p>
  
      <p>Overall, CookMate pushed our development skills in architecture, teamwork, testing, and UI/UX. We're proud of the progress and excited about what we accomplished as a team.</p>
